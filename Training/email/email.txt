Subject: Leave application | 18th Feb to 20th Feb 2022 | Ridhdhi Satoniya
Body:
Dear Sir/Ma'am,
Hope you are doing well.
I am writing this email regarding my leave application. I was really excited when I came to know a day before for my cousin brother's marriage function from 18th Feb 2022 - Monday to 20th Feb 2022 - Wednesday. This is a three days event and I have to be present at all the functions as we are very close to each other and I have to be there for all functions preparations.
I am working on the XYZ project with A, B and C person and I will make sure, I will send the proper status and necessary information to them so that they can work smoothly in my absence. I will be available on call for the first 2 days of my leave and will help my team if they need any. I might not be available on call on the 3rd day of my leave as I might be facing network issues at the wedding place.
It would be appreciated if I get your approval of the stated leaves so I can plan and book my tickets. Do let me know if you need any further clarification on the same. I will send you the marriage invitation as proof as soon as I get it.
Thanks and have a nice day!
Regards
